title: Why I Chose Bloc?
---

Before starting Bloc, like my other bootcamp students, I've tried using many different free tutorials on the web, such as Codecademy. I also followed along a book called "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Albert Sweigart. While these are great introductory resources for getting a feel for what coding is like, my experience has been that while you can learn basic coding techniques and syntax from them, they don't seem to do a very thorough job of showing you how to apply those concepts toward building a real application. Another downside is there isn't really a feedback loop to tell you whether you are on the right track or to answer any questions you may have along the way. This is when I started exploring other options aside from self-study and primarily there were two options: 1) get a CS degree from an accredited institution or 2) enroll in a bootcamp

In my case, a full 4-year degree doesn't make too much sense since I already have a bachelors and masters degree. In addition, these programs are incredibly expensive. Another concern I had was whether the curriculum at these academic institutions were in tune with the mainstream technologies practices used in the field. From experience, universities tend to be very theory-driven and very little of what is taught is actually used in the field, but this may be different for CS. One thing I found when doing my research was that employers typically found that bootcamp grads lacked an understanding of software engineering principles like data structures and algorithms. However, CS grads excelled in this realm. This quickly became one of the key criteria I had when evaluating bootcamps.

I understood that although bootcamps were cheaper than attending a traditional university, they still represented a sizable investment, so I definitely wanted to choose one that fit my needs and goals. I did a lot of research, read the majority of the reviews on SwitchUp and Coursereport, attended several info sessions, and reviewed what each bootcamp has to offer. Several aspects particularly appealed to me about Bloc:

-----
***Software Engineering/Developer Track:*** This was exactly one I was looking for in a bootcamp. Bloc really listened to what employers are saying and incorporated an entire module covering core software engineering principles. There is also an Open Source Apprenticeship after this section.

-----

***One-to-One Mentorship:*** Depending on your pace, you meet with a mentor from 1 to 3 times a week to go over core concepts, pair program and get advice.

-----

***Online-Learning:*** All of Bloc's course material and learning happen online, and students go through very detailed checkpoints to learn programming. If they get stuck, that's where the mentorship comes in. In my particular case, financially, quitting my job to attend an in-person bootcamp for ~12 weeks was not feasible. Bloc allows me to learn remotely, but keep in mind, that this requires a lot of discipline. It's very different compared to attending an in-person bootcamp where you go to class everyday, sit there and code. You really have to know how to manage your time well to maximize your learning. As a beginner, if I stepped away from coding for a few days, I often find myself spending twice as much time trying to remember and pick up where I left off.

All in all, so far I'm nearing the end of the Frontend section and about to venture into Backend. I'm pretty pleased with what Bloc has to offer. The mentors are all very knowledgeable and helpful. My current mentor, Kevin, does a wonderful job explaining concepts, offering me tips and advice when I'm struggling. There's also a very active Slack community at Bloc, where students often bounce their ideas or ask other students and mentors for help. I'm very excited to be at Bloc, and every day I look forward to what I'm going to learn next!
