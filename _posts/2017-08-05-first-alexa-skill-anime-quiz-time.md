title: My First Alexa Skill - Anime Quiz Time
---

*It's been a while since I've last blogged...*

Well, guess what? A lot has happened since and I need to start blogging again. In particular, I just finished Bloc Pong, which is a pong replica that is built purely with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. It was a very fun experience dealing with animation and gameplay, but that's for a separate blog post. Today is about ALEXA!!!

***So why did I choose to do an Alexa project?***

The biggest reason is probably curiosity and interest in voice technology and how it works with AI. I find that it's very important to keep that interest level high since it really gives you that extra push when you need it most.

*Side Note: I also want to see how I might be able to integrate voice technology into my VR app.*

***Anime Quiz Time***

You might be wondering why I chose to do an anime quiz app. Well...because I love anime! In fact, it is through the anime *Sword Art Online* that I became fascinated with virtual reality. Before deciding on doing an anime quiz, another idea I had was doing an acronym quiz, but it seems like there are already plenty of existing Alexa skills that do that.Also, an acronym could have many different valid interpretations. In the end, I came down to building a quiz on a topic I love.

***Learning Experiences***

For my first skill, a trivia one, Alexa makes it extremely easy to implement and deploy. There are step-by-step instructions on how to build a trivia skill and boilerplate code where you simply just update the questions and answers that you want to include in your skill. However, to build more complex apps, you would really need to understand the building blocks of Alexa skills.

Overall, the biggest learning experience for me was envisioning what kind of app would make sense for Alexa. Alexa is meant to be primarily voice-controlled, which is contrary to how the majority of us interact with apps these days. Most of us are used to having a visual interface to interact with, so developing Alexa skills really requires considering what is the most natural way to interact through voice.

More to come on Alexa as I work on my next skill. Stay tuned!
