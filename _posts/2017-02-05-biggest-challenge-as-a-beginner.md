title: Biggest Challenge as a Beginner Developer
---

I started my journey with Bloc, an online coding bootcamp, to become a software developer about 6 months ago in July 2016, and I've gone through a lot. More than I ever would have been able to go through through self-studying. I've built BlocJams, a Spotify replica that taught me step-by-step how HTML/CSS and JavaScript go together in a web application. I've incorporated jQuery and then completely rebuilt the app using AngularJS. All of this was course-led, and new concepts were being introduced with each checkpoint. I agree with my mentor, Kevin, that this is probably the nature of bootcamps and only with more practice will I be able to internalize these concepts. So far, whenever I get stuck, I formulate what I'm trying to do and either 1) refer to a previous checkpoint that covers the concept and mimic the solution or 2) Google it!

In the first case, I understand the concept but don't remember the exact solution. In the second case, I'm looking for the missing piece whether it be some method out there that I haven't seen before or a solution I never thought of. Most of the time, Google returns several solutions from StackOverflow, but usually I can't fully comprehend the solution being presented, because typically answers already assume a certain technical understanding.

*But...I'm not quite there yet.*

Reading documentation is currently my biggest challenge as a beginner developer. A plethora of information exists out there on the web, waiting to be consumed and put to use, but I don't know where to begin, because it's confusing wherever I go. I like to use the analogy of the job market and hiring. If you look at job ads, most of them say something like *3-5 years of experience in xxx* But what about someone coming fresh out of college? They need to start somewhere to get to that experience level, but they can't if companies are all looking for that experience level to begin with. This is how I view most of the documentation available out there. It is written by experienced developers for experienced developers. That, in turn, creates high barriers to entry for beginner developers like me, who are eager to learn but not equipped to.

Don't get me wrong. I'm very grateful for the tutorials, videos and documentation out there, but at the same time, I wish there was a guide on reading and understanding documentation so that I can better appreciate and consume the material that many developers have poured their hearts into making.
