title: My Goals as a Software Developer
---

Ever since high school, I was convinced that I would study Business and make a career out of it. Needless to say, I attended a business school, but during my studies, I had to pick a concentration because business encompasses many disciplines, such as operations, management, finance, marketing, etc. Finance stood out to me, because I liked numbers and the concepts. Plus I was good at it.

After graduating, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I enjoyed studying Finance in class but was unclear what path appealed to me. Most of my peers either landed jobs in investment banking or equity research. Eventually I got a job in accounting, but something was missing.

*I wasn't driven...*

In my current role, as an accountant, once I've done the work a few times, things quickly become repetitive and uninteresting. Month over month, I find myself performing the same tasks over and over again. I found myself building templates in Microsoft Excel to automate some of those tasks, but still...something didn't feel right.

*That's when I thought to myself...this is pretty boring...*

Work is probably where people spend most of their lives, so why not make the most out of it? But where do I start? How do I figure out what I really want to do? A starting point is probably what I currently enjoy doing.

During my free time, my biggest hobby is watching Japanese anime, or animation. For those of you not familiar with anime, they are essentially adaptations of manga, or Japanese comics. The manga industry in Japan is a pretty competitive industry whereby manga artists would draw comics and compete for rankings. Manga that perform extremely well through subscriber reviews eventually get offers for anime adaptation, so typically what this means is that what ends up being broadcasted on TV are the best of the best stories. This is why I love watching anime. I want to experience what story the author is trying to depict. And, needless to say, what made me consider software development as a career change came from inspiration from an anime called Sword Art Online.

Sword Art Online (SAO) is an adventure story that takes place about 100 years into the future. The hero, Kirito, ventures into a VRMMORPG *(virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game)* world and has the clear the game in order to escape. The storyline was amazing but the technology and experience captivated me even more. The VR technology available in the story was a full-dive technology, which means our five senses are fully immersed into the virtual world. Here is one snapshot of the SAO world.

What this means is that if full-dive VR becomes a reality, we can create new and fascinating experiences and go wherever our imagination takes us. Many worlds can exist and even fantasy, like flying dragons, would no longer be a dream.

This is my motivation to becoming a software developer. I want to be able to ***create*** and ***experience!***
