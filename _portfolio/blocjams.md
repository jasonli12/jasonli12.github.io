## Explanation

BlocJams, a replica of Spotify, is a project I worked on during my study at Bloc. The objective of the project is allow me to practice and learn core programming skills, such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, DOM scripting, jQuery and AngularJS.

## Problem

Many online music players today, including Spotify, display ads when you utilize the page or play a song. This, in turn, negatively affects the user experience, especially on mobile devices where screen real-estate is limited.

## Solution

------
### *Simplicity*
------

Simplicity is at the heart of BlocJams. When a user first visits BlocJams, I want him or her to understand why BlocJams is amazing. On the landing page, I show a simple background of someone listening to music and at the bottom the key differentiators of BlocJams:
* Vast music selection
* Unlimited streaming and ad-free
* Mobile friendly and responsive

On the song player page, I show only the key elements a user may be interested in:

* Artist and album information
* List of songs in the album
* Player bar at the bottom of the page

For ease of navigating between songs, a user can either 1) hover over the song number on the left and click **play** or 2) click on the **next** or **previous** buttons in the player bar.

### *Mobile Friendly*
------

Everyone should be able to enjoy music on-the-go. To put users one-step closer to accessing their favorite music wherever they are, I made BlocJams responsive and adaptive to users regardless of the device they are on. BlocJams scales to the screen size of the device each user is using and still makes its features easily accessible.

## Results

I have tested BlocJams on a variety of devices, and I am pretty satisfied with the results. The navigation is very intuitive. BlocJams  contains only the core features of a music player. All the page elements resize and adjust as we switch between devices of varying screen sizes while maintaining the application's simplicity and ease of use.

## Conclusion

Going into this project was challenging yet exciting since it requires putting together all the concepts I have learned into a viable product. While simple, BlocJams delivers a refreshing and responsive experience to its users. Moving forward, I will likely continue to add features, while keeping in mind the core value that users ultimately want to be able to access the music they enjoy wherever they are, and the following additions will bring them one-step closer:

* Create custom playlists.
* Provide recommendations based on what other users who listen to the same songs listen to.
