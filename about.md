Hi! I'm Jason and I'm on my way to making a career change to become a software developer. I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp called Bloc in their Software Developer Track and hacking away every day. Upon graduation, I hope to work my way into the VR industry and start creating and connecting people with immersive experiences. Aside from diving deep into code every day, in my free time, I enjoy watching anime, reading manga, learning Japanese, eating, playing badminton, and fooling around with my dogs. I have two Shih Tzus, and they're twins!
